✅ 1. Working Prototype (Command Line Email Assistant)
📌 Goal:
Demo script jo email read kare aur polite reply generate kare using transformers.

🔧 Tools:
Python

Huggingface transformers pipeline

Gmail API (optional, for real inbox reading)

Slack API (optional)
🔥 Minimal Example (Jupyter script → Python script):
python



from transformers import pipeline

generator = pipeline("text2text-generation", model="google/flan-t5-base")

emails = [
    "Hi Komal, can you send me the latest project report by tonight?",
    "Hey, are you available for a call tomorrow morning at 10?",
    "Kindly share the agenda for Monday's meeting."
]

for email in emails:
    prompt = f"Read this email and write a polite professional reply:\n\n{email}"
    reply = generator(prompt, max_length=100)[0]['generated_text']
    print(f"\n📧 Email: {email}\n✉️ Reply: {reply}\n{'-'*50}")
Save this as main.py in src/controllers/.
